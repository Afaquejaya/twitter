To get started with it, follow the instructions:

```
1. Set up the development environment using Getting Started section of official React Native website.

2. Perform the following commands in CMD or Git:

(a) git clone https://github.com/sidhuparas/twitter.git
(b) cd twitter
(c) npm install
(d) react-native run-android
```
Command (c) will install dependencies while (d) will start the app in emulator or connected android device. Since I have used Windows laptop to develop it, it may not run on Mac/iOS.
